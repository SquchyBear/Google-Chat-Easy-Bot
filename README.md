# Google-Chat-Easy-Bot
This is a wrapper for interacting with Google Chat with a program. This simplifies interacting with Google Chat with a program, so you don't have to look though docs and write lots of code and waste time./

## Quickstart for webhook
```
from Google-Chat-Easy-Bot import webhook

url = "YOUR-GOOGLE-CHAT-WEBHOOK-URL"
chat = webhook.webhook(url):
chat.message("Hello World")

# The message "Hello World" will appear in the chat with the webhook.
```

Work is in progress...
